SeVN - The sunday evening VN engine
===================================

I played a bit of VN for some reason and then I reversed it a bit and found out
that it was powered by [Ren'Py](http://www.renpy.org/) so I wanted to write
something similar but in JS.

The example game 'The Question' is stolen from their tutorial, because it is
awesome and such. Maybe I'll write my own tutorial game at some point.
